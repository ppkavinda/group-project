            <ul><li>500 g extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>100 g coconut oil (Regular coconut oil that melts around 76ÂºF)</li>
            <li>10 g lavender essential oil</li>
            <li>80 g lye NaOH (Sodium hydroxide)</li>
            <li>195 g water</li></ul>

            <h3><strong>Instructions</strong><h3>
            <p> Discuss about how to manufaturing about soap step by step</p>
<ol><li>Mix your lye into your water . Do this in a recipient that can handle heat; I used a glass bowl. It is best to do this step outside so that you do not
 fill your house with the fumes. Try not to breath them in!! Once the lye has dissolved, leave the mix to cool in an area where no kids or pets have access to it!!!</li>
<li>Meanwhile, you can weigh and mix your olive and coconut oils. I mixed them in a large, glass bowl with room for adding and mixing the other ingredients.</li>
<li>After the lye mixture has cooled a bit, bring it back inside and pour into your oil mix. Mix them together gently at first.</li>
<li>Once your lye mix has been incorporated into your oils, you can start to blend them with a hand blender. Be careful not to spray the mixture all over!!</li>
 <li>I blended mine in the bottom of my sink, and distanced myself as much as the blender would allow, just in case!! You can do this step by hand, but it supposedly will take a very long time.</li>
When your mixture starts to chicken like mayonnaise, after a few minutes, you are at the stage that is called "trace." That is what you want!!!</li>
<li>Mix in your essential oils.</li>
<li>Pour into soap molds. (I used a silicone pan and some plastic containers. It is a good idea to oil the plastic containers beforehand to prevent sticking.)</li>
<li>Cover and set aside for at least 24 hours. It will probably get warm. If you cover it with a cloth to keep the warmth in, it supposedly contributes to the quality of the soap. </li>
<li>After 24 hours, uncover and see if you can unmold it. If it is too soft, wait a few more hours and unmold. You can put it in a cold place to help shrink it a little to help the process out. Do not wait too long or it will be too hard to easily cut into bars.</li>
<li>Cut into bars. I like the look of big, chunky square-ish bars. The nice thing about making your own, is that you can decide how you want to cut them.</li>
<li>Let set for around a month, turning every day or two at first, and then every week later on. This is to let your soap dry out and harden.</li>

            <p>Everyone uses us as candles as a light source. Vesak, Poson and Christmas, as well as weddings and birthday parties.
            <br><br>The candle is very easy to use and can be used as a cottage industry .It can start with a very low capital and the market risk is low .Also, you can use it again without the raw material wastage.
            <br><br>Candles can be made in a variety of shapes and colors .They are also made to suit different festivities.
            <br><br>The raw materials used in the production of candles are perfumes wax. This is a side effect of the production of petroleum, and there are two types of wines made up of both Malaysian and Indonesian. Malaysian wax is white and it is best suited to this industry.
            <br><br><br>In addition, Stearic Acid is used as an ingredient .These can be purchased as a thick dye and peas. Stearic acid is added to the candle for high diameters, forcing candles to strengthen in order not to drag, transparent or overwhelm. For most diameters of candles, Stearic acid is not indispensable.
            <br><br>This is an easy-to-use technique, so anyone can reach the candle production and enhance high-end earning revenue through various events.
